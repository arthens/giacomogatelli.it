# About me

Hi there! My name is Giacomo Gatelli, and I'm an Italian geek.
I was born and raised in [Brescia](https://www.google.com/search?q=brescia&amp;tbm=isch),
a small city in the north of Italy.

I moved to [Edinburgh](https://www.google.com/search?q=edinburgh&amp;tbm=isch) to study when I was 24 year old. I meant to stay there one year, but I ended up staying for almost 4.

In 2012 I decided it was time to move back to Italy, and I ended up in [Melbourne](https://www.google.com/search?q=melbourne&amp;tbm=isch), where I currently live. You don't understand? Yeah, me neither.

I'm currently working as a Software Engineer for [99designs.com](https://99designs.com).

In my free time I like to code (how original), play games (big DOTA2 fan here), read books, cook and organize games of [Werewolf](https://www.facebook.com/PubWerewolfStK).
